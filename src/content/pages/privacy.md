## Who we are

Our website address is: [https://radiotutor.uk](https://radiotutor.uk). The administrators for this website are Peter Barnes, MØSWN and Ben Chalmers, MØNBA. Peter can be contacted at [peter@m0swn.uk](mailto:peter@m0swn.uk)

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Session Data

When you use our site, you are allocated a session ID number. This allows you to leave the site partway through a test, and return later to continue the test. No personal information is kept as part of session data.

### Embedded content from other websites

This site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

## Who we share your data with

### Analytics

We don't share any personal data from this site with any other party. We do use Google Analytics to help us monitor the usage of this site, but this does not involve the sharing of any identifiable data.

### User Accounts

For users that register on our website (not currently available), we store the personal information they provide when registering their account. This includes an email address and password. This data is kept for as long as the user's account is open

## What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Where we send your data

## Additional information

### How we protect your data

The only people with access to your data are the administrators of this website. Currently, this is limited only to Peter Barnes, MØSWN and Ben Chalmers, MØNBA. This access does not extend to passwords, which are only ever stored in an encrypted format and thus are never readable to the site administrators.

### What data breach procedures we have in place

In the unlikely event of a breach of this site, our first cause of action would be to automatically lock out all users of the site, and then force every user to create a new password. This action would provide a good line of defence against an intruder who were to deliberately breach one of the accounts of this site. We would send out an email to every user of the site, warning them of the breach and that they will need to change their passwords on their next login. If required, we would take the site offline while we find out the cause of the breach, and leave it offline until we are happy that the security of the site has been reestablished.

### What third parties we receive data from

We don't recieve any data about you from 3rd parties

We have a system in place for this an aim to answer such a request within 48 hours.
